# Hierarchical_Clustering
Heirarchical clustering on simple data:

         This Clustering algorithm treates each data point as a clusters,say n.
   Then the 2 nearest clusters are merged into one cluster to form n-1 Clusters.
   This process continues till one Cluster is formed containing all the data points.
   The algorithm usues a dendrogram to keep track of this process.
      From the dendrogram optimum number of Clusters can be determined and 
   Using this optimum number of Clusters as an input to the algorithm 
   Clusters are created.
