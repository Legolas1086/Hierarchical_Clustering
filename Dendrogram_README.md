Dendrogram:

       This is a kind of graph which contains the distance between the closest 
  clusters at each step of Aggloramative hierarchical clustering on basis of which 
  clusters are merged. Now from this optimum number of clusters are choosen.
  The longest vertical line which will not be intersected by any hrizontal line
  when horizontal lines are extended is choosen. A horizontal line is drawn across
  the graph intersectin this vertical line(Imaginary or in mind), now the number
  of vertical lines intersected by this imaginary horizontal line is the optimum
  number of Clusters.
